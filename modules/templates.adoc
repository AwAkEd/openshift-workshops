## Lab: Using Templates

### Background: Templates
Running all these individual commands can be tedious and error prone.
Fortunately for you, all of this configuration can be put together into a single
*Template* which can then be processed to create a full set of resources. As you
saw with MongoDB, a *Template* may define parameters for certain values, such as
DB username or password, and they can be automatically generated by OpenShift at
processing time.

Administrators can load *Templates* into OpenShift and make them available to
all users, even via the web console. Users can create *Templates* and load them
into their own *Projects* for other users (with access) to share and use.

The great thing about *Templates* is that they can speed up the deployment
workflow for application development by providing a "recipe" of sorts that can
be deployed with a single command.  Not only that, they can be loaded into
OpenShift from an external URL, which will allow you to keep your templates in a
version control system. And, even further, they can be stored in a version
control system (even in the same repository as the application source code) --
they're just serialized text data!

Let's combine all of the exercises we have performed in the last several labs by
using a *Template* that we can instantiate with a single command.  While we
could have used templates to deploy everything in the workshop today, remember
that it is important for you to understand how to create, deploy, and wire
resources together.

#### Exercise: Instantiate a Template

The front end application we've been working with this whole time will display
as many back end services' data as are created. Adding more stuff with the right
*Label* will make more stuff show up on the map.

Now you will deploy a map of Major League Baseball stadiums in the US by using a
template. It is pre-configured to build the back end Java application, and
deploy the Mongo database. It also uses a *Hook* to call the `/ws/data/load/`
endpoint to cause the data to be loaded into the database from a JSON file in
the source code repository. Execute the following command:

[source]
----
oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-roadshow/mlbparks/master/ose3/application-template-{{MW_NAME}}.json
----

What just happened? What did you just `create`? The item that we passed to the `create`
command is a *Template*. `create` simply makes the template available in
your *Project*. You can see this with the following command:

[source]
----
oc get template
NAME       DESCRIPTION                                                                  PARAMETERS     OBJECTS
mlbparks   Application template MLBParks backend running on {{MW_TEXT}} and using MongoDB 15 (5 blank)   8
----

Are you ready for the magic command?  Here it is:

{% if USE_MAVEN %}
[source]
----
oc new-app mlbparks --name=mlbparks -p GIT_URI=https://github.com/openshift-roadshow/mlbparks -p MAVEN_MIRROR_URL=http://nexus.workshop-infra.svc.cluster.local:8081/content/groups/public
----

{% else %}
[source]
----
oc new-app mlbparks --name=mlbparks -p GIT_URI=https://github.com/openshift-roadshow/mlbparks 
----

{% endif %}

You will see the following output:

{% if USE_MAVEN %}

OpenShift will now:

* Configure and start a build
{% if USE_MAVEN %}
** Using the supplied Maven mirror URL
{% endif %}
** From the supplied source code repository
* Configure and deploy MongoDB
** Using auto-generated user, password, and database name
* Configure environment variables for the app to connect to the DB
* Create the correct services
* Label the app service with `type=parksmap-backend`

All with one command!

When the build is complete, visit the parks map. Does it work? Think about how
this could be used in your environment.  For example, a template could define a
large set of resources that make up a "reference application", complete with
several app servers, databases, and more.  You could deploy the entire set of
resources with one command, and then hack on them to develop new features,
microservices, fix bugs, and more.

As a final exercise, look at the template that was used to create the
resources for our *mlbparks* application.
